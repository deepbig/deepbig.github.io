<p>What's a beer shop? BeerShop features 16 lines of revolving beer on tap and over 250 different packaged beers. Packaged beer can be consumed at our shop or taken take home. We also serve a limited amount of cider, wine, non-alcoholic beverages, coffee and pastry (on weekends). Finally, we sell merchandise including hats, beanies, shirts, hoodies and gift cards. We do not have a kitchen, but guests are encouraged to order food for delivery from our restaurant neighbors.
</p>
<p>What kind of beer do you serve? Our main focus is Chicago-land's exploding local beer scene. However, we also carry beer from all over the country and world. Each of our tap lines are dedicated to different styles of beer ensuring that a wide variety is always presented.
</p>
<p>So what's the vibe inside? A fun, irreverent but knowledgable staff pouring great beer that is always changing. Our customers span all ages and often are accompanied by their children, parents, and even dogs. What I don't want BeerShop to be is just a bar, or a snobby place for beer nerds. I want BeerShop to be fun, relaxed and selling great beer from friendly, helpful people. Hopefully, we've succeeded.
</p>
<p>
Are there special events? Yes, we themed trivia nights, vinyl dj sets, food truck features & other oddities happening throughout the year.

So what's your deali-o? After moonlighting at Dublin, CA's Caps and Taps, I quit a banking job in San Francisco and moved our family half way across the country to start BeerShop. My hope is to create a space where people can discover what this whole "craft beer phenomenon" is all about.
